PLUGIN 1: DICOM TO SOFA MODEL
dicom file explained (source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCECXr-HxVs)
The video explains the main components and benefits of DICOM, a standardized format and network protocol for medical images exchange. It covers the use of service object pairs to translate real-world data, the inclusion of patient information and acquisition data in DICOM files, and how the universal adoption of DICOM makes it easier for medical professionals to connect imaging devices to the network. DICOM is not just a file format, but also includes networking protocols and a detailed procedure for how DICOM devices connect to each other. The system is intricate and contains data that explain what the patient is and what machine was used.
00:00:00 In this section, the main components and benefits of DICOM are covered. The DICOM file format and the DICOM network protocol work together to standardize medical images and their exchange, making it easier for medical professionals to diagnose and treat patients. DICOM files hold more than just the image, as they also contain patient information and acquisition data. The DICOM network protocol is used to search for imaging studies and retrieve them for display. The use of service object pairs helps to translate real-world data into DICOM objects that can be acted upon by DICOM services, such as move, find, and store. The universal adoption of DICOM as a medical imaging standard means that all imaging devices use DICOM, making them easier to connect to the network.
00:05:00 In this section, it is explained that DICOM is not just a file format, but also contains networking protocols that identify something by a collection of its attributes. DICOM uses services to perform functions on the objects and includes a detailed procedure for how DICOM devices connect to each other including the DICOM handshake. It is stated that imaging devices and systems have a standard protocol set forth to become standard, with a greeting and exchange of basic information. DICOM is an intricate system that includes not only what makes up an image, but also data around that which explains what the patient is and what machine was used.

SOFA deformable object
You need the mesh file and volume file
Mesh Files: Mesh files, such as .obj, .stl, or .vtk, represent 3D models as a collection of polygons (often triangles or quadrilaterals). They define vertices (points in 3D space), edges (lines connecting vertices), and faces (polygons made up of edges). Meshes are often used to represent the surfaces of 3D objects. They are particularly suited for complex, irregular shapes, and are widely used in computer graphics and 3D printing.

Volume Files: Volume files, such as .raw, .mhd, or .mha, represent 3D models as a stack of 2D image slices or as a 3D grid of voxels (volume pixels). Each voxel contains a scalar value representing a property of the data at that point in space (for example, density, intensity, or a material property). Volume files are often used in medical imaging (for example, CT or MRI scans) and scientific simulations, where it's necessary to represent the internal structure of a 3D object, not just its surface.

Solved with cloned repository dicom2stl and generate_mesh.py

I don't need a plugin to do this since it can happen outside SOFA.

The output of this process are only the two files .obj and .msh
.obj files: The Wavefront OBJ (Object) file format is a widely used format for representing 3D geometry. It stores information about vertices, normals, texture coordinates, and face connectivity. In the context of Sofa, .obj files are typically used to define the shape and appearance of objects in a simulation. For example, if you want to simulate a sofa, you can create or obtain an .obj file that describes its geometry (vertex positions, polygons, etc.) along with any associated material properties such as textures and colors. The .obj file can then be loaded into Sofa to create the corresponding object within the simulation.

.msh files: The .msh file format is not specific to Sofa but is commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational physics. It is a binary or ASCII file format that stores information about the mesh, which is a discretized representation of an object's geometry used for numerical calculations. A mesh consists of nodes (vertices) and elements (e.g., triangles or tetrahedra) that connect these nodes to form a meshed surface or volume. In the context of Sofa, .msh files can be used to import pre-defined meshes or generate custom meshes for objects in a simulation. The .msh file contains the necessary data to define the mesh topology, node positions, and element connectivity.

In both cases, when using Sofa, you would typically load these files into the framework using appropriate components or plugins provided by Sofa. These components can interpret the data in the files and create the corresponding simulation objects with the desired geometry and mesh.

These are called in load_data.scn called from sofa->open
