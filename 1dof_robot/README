# How to
1. Collect data from experiments on the robot: save images of the current robot configuration and name the image as pressure_force.jpg or pressure.jpg if free motion
2. Run image_processing.py to build the dataset: a csv table with columns: pressure,force,radius,curvature,arc_length,x_tip,y_tip,x_base,y_base
3. Run get_models_from_data.m to process the dataset and get the models for curvature and elongation (robot dependent kinematics)
4. Run shape_optimization.m to get the complete force model 
5. Run force_test.m to test the force model against the data

# Extras
force_model_analysis.m is to visualize the theoretical force model

sofa_vs_real.py is to compare the behavior of the robot simulated in SOFA against the real robot experiment
